    # NOTE: Some patches are applied manually because they -do- apply, just not cleanly, ie with patch fuzz.
    # A detailed list of why the above patches are disabled is listed below:

    # winex11-_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW - Causes origin to freeze
    # winex11-WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING - Causes origin to freeze
    # user32-alttab-focus - relies on winex11-_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW -- may be able to be added now that EA Desktop has replaced origin?
    # winex11-MWM_Decorations - not compatible with fullscreen hack
    # server-Signal_Thread - breaks steamclient for some games -- notably DBFZ
    # ntdll-Junction_Points - breaks CEG drm
    # server-Stored_ACLs - requires ntdll-Junction_Points
    # server-File_Permissions - requires ntdll-Junction_Pointsv
    # kernel32-CopyFileEx - breaks various installers
    # shell32-Progress_Dialog - relies on kernel32-CopyFileEx
    # shell32-ACE_Viewer - adds a UI tab, not needed, relies on kernel32-CopyFileEx
    # dbghelp-Debug_Symbols - Ubisoft Connect games (3/3 I had installed and could test) will crash inside pe_load_debug_info function with this enabled
