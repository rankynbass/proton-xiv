user32: [GAMEFIX] 1/2 Dragon Age Inquisition: fix xinput support

https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47070

I'm not completely sure on the specifics of why the bug happens,
but there are two main threads involved. Thread A owns the window
object for the game. Thread B makes all the calls to XInputGetState.
However, Thread B checks if the window has focus to receive keyboard
inputs every frame. Thread B calls AttachThreadInput to attach its
message queue to the Thread A's window a few times before the bug
starts occurring along with one separate time at the start where
Thread A attaches Thread B's message queue to the window as well.
The message queue is detached one last time and then Thread B no
longer has access to the window.

My workaround checks GetFocus for when it starts receiving Null
for a response (meaning it does not have access to a window anymore).
Prior to this, AttachThreadInput stores the IDs of the two threads
which call the function the very first time (hopefully this works
with the EA App as I've been debugging this with Origin which doesn't
seem to call either of the two WINAPI functions as long as you load
straight into the game from the Origin library menu). When GetFocus
realizes it does not have a window for the thread, it calls
AttachThreadInput with the two thread IDs. This allows Thread B to
access the window, which let's GetFocus return the proper window
handle, which then let's the program access XInputGetState meaning
the controller finally works.

Anyway, as far as the final cause of the bug: it might be because
of thread prioritization causing Thread B to AttachThreadInput to
be called by it last as the only time Thread A calls it, it does
not detach the message queue afterwards. This leads me to believe
that the bug might just be caused by incomplete wine
functionality / stubs. Although, this part is speculation.

Wrap hack with a SteamGameId check and cache it.
